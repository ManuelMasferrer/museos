Post-Impressionism emerged as a reaction against Impressionists' concern for the naturalistic depiction of light and colour. Due to its broad emphasis on abstract qualities or symbolic content, Post-Impressionism encompasses Les Nabis, Neo-Impressionism, Symbolism, Cloisonnism, Pont-Aven School, as well as Synthetism, along with some later Impressionists' work. The movement was led by Paul Cézanne (known as the father of Post-Impressionism), Paul Gauguin, Vincent van Gogh and Georges Seurat.\\nThe term Post-Impressionism was first used by art critic Roger Fry in 1906. Critic Frank Rutter in a review of the Salon d'Automne published in Art News, 15 October 1910, described Othon Friesz as a \\\"post-impressionist leader\\\"; there was also an advert for the show The Post-Impressionists of France. Three weeks later, Roger Fry used the term again when he organised the 1910 exhibition Manet and the Post-Impressionists, defining it as the development of French art since Manet.\\nPost-Impressionists extended Impressionism while rejecting its limitations: they continued using vivid colours, often thick application of paint and real-life subject matter, but were more inclined to emphasize geometric forms, distort form for expressive effect, and use unnatural or arbitrary colour.\",\n                \"countryOfOrigin\": \"France\",\n                \"activeYears\": \"Between 1886 and 1905\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"artworks\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": 102,\n                \"name\": \"Self portrait\",\n                \"year\": 1931,\n                \"description\": \"Painted in 1948, Cossington Smith's self-portrait represents her vibrant use of light-infused colour and interest in structure and form.

The movement was partially inspired by Cubism and was introduced to the public by means of the publication of the Vorticist manifesto in Blast magazine. Familiar forms of representational art were rejected in favour of a geometric style that tended towards a hard-edged abstraction. Lewis proved unable to harness the talents of his disparate group of avant-garde artists; however, for a brief period Vorticism proved to be an exciting intervention and an artistic riposte to Marinetti's Futurism and the post-impressionism of Roger Fry's Omega Workshops.\\nVorticist paintings emphasised 'modern life' as an array of bold lines and harsh colours drawing the viewer's eye into the centre of the canvas and vorticist sculpture created energy and intensity through 'direct carving'.\",\n                \"countryOfOrigin\": \"England\",\n                \"activeYears\": \"Between 1912 and 1915\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"artworks\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": 109,\n                \"name\": \"The Mud Bath\",\n                \"year\": 1914,\n                \"description\": \"Bathing figures were a traditional way of depicting the nude, but here Bomberg brings the subject into the modern era by basing the scene on steam baths used by the local Jewish population near Bomberg's home in east London.

Their aim was to create art that expressed the modern world through imagery derived from machines and the urban environment.

Breadth, height, and depth are almost equally developed; the balance of these dimensions is one of the sources of the fullness and calm of the painting. We experience the vastness of the space in the broad valley with the viaduct; we feel the equivalent depth in the long, endless passage from the house in the foreground to the mountain top; but we also measure the great height of the space in the central tree which spans the whole vertical dimension, crossing every zone of the landscape and reaching from the lower to the upper edge of the canvas.\",\n                \"type\": \"Painting\"\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"id\": 105,\n        \"name\": \"Vincent van Gogh\",\n        \"birthplace\": \"Zundert, Netherlands\",\n        \"birthdate\": \"1853-03-30T04:56:16.000Z\",\n        \"image\": \"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Vincent_van_Gogh_-_Self-Portrait_-_Google_Art_Project_%28454045%29.jpg/474px-Vincent_van_Gogh_-_Self-Portrait_-_Google_Art_Project_%28454045%29.jpg\",\n        \"movements\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": 101,\n                \"name\": \"Post-Impressionism\",\n                \"description\": \"Post-Impressionism (also spelled Postimpressionism) was a predominantly French art movement that developed roughly between 1886 and 1905, from the last Impressionist exhibition to the birth of Fauvism.
